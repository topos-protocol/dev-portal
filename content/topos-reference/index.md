## Weak Causal Probabilistic Reliable Broadcast

The TCE is responsible for propagating and securely delivering, in a secure and performant manner, UCI certificates. The TCE, however, does not use consensus as a vehicle to achieve this. Instead, it uses a different cryptographic primitive, called Weak Causal Probabilistic Reliable Broadcast (WCPRB). Understanding WPCRB is helpful to understand Topos and the TCE. Refer to the [Weak Causal Probabilistic Reliable Broadcast](/content/topos-reference/wcprb.html) page for more details.
