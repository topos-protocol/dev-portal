## Welcome
    
Welcome to the Topos Dev Portal. The resources here will provide you with everything you need to begin developing with Topos, the first zero-knowledge blockchain ecosystem, which will allow you to deploy sovereign execution layers and dApps with native interoperability and cryptographic security.

_The portal is divided into two chapters:_

* In the first chapter, you will find foundational information regarding Topos technology and how you can use it. The chapter describes the concepts behind Topos, and outlines the advantages Topos brings when you develop smart contracts or build dApps.
* In the second chapter, you will take your first steps with Topos and become familiar with the Topos Stack. It presents a sample messaging protocol, which will help you to see the connections between the different components and better understand their purpose.
