# Topos Testnet

The Topos protocol is undergoing heavy development and features will be rolled out incrementally over time until mainnet is launched in 2024. The phases outlined below will change as detailed planning progresses.

- Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
	- Basic building blocks, e.g.
		- Networking and block production/propagation
		- Node synchronization and transactions processing
		- Smart Contract deployment and interaction
	- Fully working system, ready for early adopters to use &lt;-- YOU ARE HERE!
- Phase 2: Community
	- Open the Topos ecosystem to interact with third party testnets
	- ZK-related developer tooling
	- Refinement and polish of Phase 1 components
	- Community on-boarding and involvement
- Phase 3: Ecosystem
	- Staking, delegation and token issuance mechanics
	- On-chain governance
	- Permissionless subnet registration
	- Complete tooling suite (e.g. explorer, exchange integration tools, “stdlib” for Smart contract developers etc)
- Phase 4: Advanced features
	- Certificates are threshold signed, pubkey as registration key/ID, and key resharing enabled (ICE-FROST)
	- Oracle integration
	- On-chain protocol upgrades
	- zkEVM integration
- Phase 5: Security and stress test
	- Penetration Testing
	- Bounty Programs
	- Network Stress Testing
	- Cryptography Audits
	- Smart Contract Audits
	- TCE Audits
