## Setup and local development

We recommend you run the platform locally to review your changes before submitting them. Please refer to the instructions in the [TECHNICAL-SETUP.md](TECHNICAL-SETUP.md) file to set up and run the app in your local environment.

## Language and style

Content production in this project follows the general conventions and best practices from the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).

## Components and platform features

The platform supports a number of custom components. You can find an overview of all components, and a demonstration of their use, within the [`/features-test/index.md`](./features-test/index.md) file - the feature test is also deployed to the [live portal](https://docs.topos.technology/features-test).

Additionally, the file [`features-test/landingpage.md`](./features-test/landingpage.md) demonstrates the use of the landingpage components, and is also deployed to the [live portal](https://docs.topos.technology/features-test/landingpage.html).
